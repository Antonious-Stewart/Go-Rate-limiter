Job Queue (In-Memory Worker Pool)
âœ… Goal

Build a simple job queue system in Go that accepts jobs (simulated tasks) and distributes them to a fixed-size worker pool.
ðŸ“‹ Requirements

Define a Job struct (ID, payload, retry count, timestamp)

Create a buffered job queue (chan Job)

Spawn N worker goroutines to listen to the queue

Simulate processing time (e.g., with time.Sleep)

Log when a job starts and finishes

Handle failed jobs with retries (exponential backoff)

Cancel jobs gracefully with context.Context

Allow enqueueing new jobs from:

CLI or

        HTTP /enqueue endpoint (optional)

ðŸŒ± Optional Features

Job priority (high vs low priority jobs)

Persist jobs to disk (JSON file or SQLite)

Admin API: view queue length, active jobs

Metrics (processed, failed, retry count)
